hey dude, Gimme a Proxy
Is a service that gives you up to date proxies, it is mainly gets those proxies data by crawling "hideMyAss.com" (those guys are doing great job in their home page to make it hard to scrap it :) )

This service has two mainly two background jobs, one to get new proxy servers data and the other one is to wipe all bad proxies.
both background jobs runs every 10 minutes.

To run it:
you need to have mvn and spring boot installed.
"mvn spring-boot:run"

Todo:
New Features:
- get proxies for an input country sorted by speed.
- get proxies for an input protocol (http, https, ..)
- combine previous two features.
- calculate the proxy speed correctly.

Cleaning:
- use java.util.logging instead of logging in the console print lines.
- clean parser, make it more smarter and parse using xml parsers not just parse strings.

Note:
Check http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/
